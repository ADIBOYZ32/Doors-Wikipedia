    <p> 


Screech is a gooey entity dwelling in dark rooms. Its body is comprised of 6 long tentacles rotating around, 2 glowing eyes and a big mouth with a perpetual grin.

Screech jumpscares players in dark rooms if they don't look at it. One of the players attracted by Screech will be notified by a 'psst' sound and must find the Screech to scare it off, otherwise it will damage the player, inflicting 1/3 of health. If a lit object is held, Screech wont be attracted and attack the player (There is still a chance for Screech to spawn). Keeping the door of a dark room open means Screech could possibly follow and attack you.</p>

<p>
    Hide is a bodiless entity hiding in hiding spots. If the player resides in the spot for far too long, it will kick the player out. It does not appear in Doors 50 and 100.</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/e/e8/DOORS_-_Rush.webp/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220831124952">
<p>
    Rush resembles a low contrast smiling face. It would go and zoom around the hotel and break the lights in each room it goes through. Its arrival is indicated by flickering the lights and a low-pitched screaming that gets louder as it gets closer. Any player caught within Rush's radius would be instantly killed.</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/7/7f/DOORS_-_Eyes.webp/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220831125033">
<p>
    The Eyes have a random chance of spawning every time the player enters a new room. It is a floating entity of purple smoke with 37 eyes. They rapidly take away the player's health if said player is looking straight at them.</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/f/f9/Halt_Updated.webp/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220923040205">
<p>
    Halt is an entity that represents a typical sheet ghost. It has blue glowing eyes and would inhabit thin hallways. When the player enters the next room, they will be taken to a dark, narrow corridor. The screen will flash blue and a text that says "TURN AROUND" will appear. If the player gets too close to Halt, the screen will flash with a text reading "RUN AWAY", and the player would lose 60% of their health. Just like Rush, it will cause the lights to flicker, but for much longer than Rush.</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/7/7d/Ambush2.webp/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220831124159">
<p>
    Ambush functions in the same fashion to Rush, it flies through the rooms and the player must find a hiding spot before it passes by. However, Ambush glows green and pink instead of the black fog that Rush has. It also features a different scream and will rush up and down the hallway a minimum of two times and maximum of six before disappearing. Like Rush, it will break the lights in the room. Unlike Rush, Ambush will not open the door to the next room. Ambush's chances of appearing increase by each room, but rarely he can appear as early as Door 2. Ambush will normally spawn 4 rooms behind the player but can spawn closer if it is door 2 or 3 or after an unloaded room (such as when Seek's chase is over or when leaving the library).

    Hide is the player's largest liability when they're face to face with Ambush, since Ambush commonly appears in later doors when Hide is quicker to kick the player out. Its hitbox operates from ray-casting, which means if there is nothing blocking the path between Ambush and the player, Ambush will kill them. Rush also has a ray-casting hitbox; however, Rush's ray-casting is significantly smaller. This means that some strategies which work for Rush do not work for Ambush.</p>

<p>
    Dupe is an entity that tricks the player by using fake doors, which are numbered incorrectly from the door the player previously entered. It would also scribble out the number of the door to confuse the player. However, unlike other entities, it cannot kill the player only inflicting damage.</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/8/8a/DOORS_-_Timothy.webp/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220831125126">
<p>
    Timothy is a spider that will rarely attack (1/200) in drawers the player opens, jumping onto the player's face and taking 5% of their health. Timothy can also be found on a web in the lobby. Timothy is one of the three entities found in the lobby.

    The player cannot be killed by Timothy, as it does very little damage and will leave the player with 1 HP if attacked with 5 HP or less.</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/6/6a/DOORS_-_Jack.webp/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220831125104">
<p>
    Jack has a chance 1/200 chances to appear inside a wardrobe when trying to enter one, and very rarely it will spawn behind the door of a room is
1/2000   chance. When spawning in a Wardrobe, Jack jumpscares the player. It does not deal any damage but will stop the player from entering the Wardrobe it appears into until the doors fully close and it disappears. When spawning behind a door, it will make a loud noise and temporarily darken the room with a dark red shade before disappearing harmlessly. Jack spawns in closets at a 1/20 chance, meaning the player can face Jack while repeatedly getting in and out of a closet when Ambush is coming.</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/2/23/DOORS_-_Figure.webp/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220831124639">
<p>
    The Figure appears to be a monstrous humanoid entity with a ribcage sticking out of its stomach and its face being a mouth. It seems to have 18 sharp teeth. The Figure is guaranteed to spawn in doors 50 and 100. The Figure is blind and will use its hearing in order to track the player. Producing noise will attract the Figure. And the player is encouraged to crouch. If the player is too close to the Figure, the Figure is able to hear the playerâ€™s heartbeat. A player can escape from the Figure using a closet nearby. If the Figure comes close to the closet that the player is hiding into, it will trigger the heartbeat minigame where the player has to time their heartbeat using Q and E keys for desktop, or LMB and RMB for console. If the player fails the minigame multiple times or gets captured, they will be killed.

    After opening the door to Door 50, the player is introduced to the library where they have to find books with clues to help crack the lock leading to Room 51. The books will be slightly brighter in color than the rest and will stick out from the shelf slightly and emit sparkling sounds if the player comes near one, similar to the sound of a key. After collecting them, they will briefly appear in the player's inventory and then disappear. The numbers and shapes will appear on the left side of the screen. There are 8 shapes, and they are circle, diamond, hexagon, pentagon, square, star, triangle and a cross. There is a desk with a note with 5 shapes and 5 Roman numerals which will help to solve the code.
    
    When the player reaches Door 100, the Figure will appear, and the player has to either find a closet or run away to a nearby storage area. The player has to find 10 buttons scattered across Door 100 and avoid the Figure wandering the hallways and a key in order to open and activate a fuse box. The electric box will set off a fuse causing a fire and makes the Figure throw itself out of a window while panicking. The fuse box has a puzzle, in order to complete it. The player must look up and watch which button to turn on and which button to turn off. They have to complete it 3 times in order to activate the elevator (successfully completing it without having to redo a section will award the player the badge Expert Technician). The Figure will break open the door behind and the player must run into the elevator in order to survive. A cutscene will begin after this in which the Figure will jump down and detach the elevator from its rope causing the player (or other players) in the elevator to rapidly fall. </p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/2/2c/DOORS_-_Seek.webp/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220831124933">
<p>
    Seek is an entity, resembling a humanoid covered in an unknown black substance. Seek will spawn on a long corridor while the player will be alerted of when Seek appears, because of the eyes that will line the walls a few doors before it arrives. The eyes will cause the lights to flicker. Though entities such as Rush, Ambush nor Halt can arrive. This mechanic is known as Seek's crescendo. It can trick some people to hide in a closet and waiting till Hide attacks.

    Upon reaching the end of a long corridor, a cutscene will trigger with Seek emerging from an unknown substance, looking like a black goo of some kind, and begin chasing the player. The player must navigate through multiple rooms and quickly find a door with the Guiding Light's help. In the final part of the chase sequence, the same long corridor will appear, but with elongated hands attempting to grab the player (causes an instant death when triggered) and fallen chandeliers falling (deals 40% damage when touched). When the player reaches the end, the door will close and the Seek will start banging on the door attempting to open it. </p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/0/0c/Jeff_Roblox_Doors.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230130032135">
<P>
    Jeff is an entity that resides in the Hotel. Its purpose is to sell items to the player in a shop. Jeff sells 4 different items every run. Notable items are the Crucifix, which stuns entities (prevents only one encounter). And the Skeleton Key, which unlocks special doors with a skull lock.   </P>  
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/5/5c/A60_.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230213115613">
<p>
    A-60 can be found by going to The Rooms easter egg. They appear on room A-060 and will spawn in a previous room behind the player. The player must hide in a locker when they hear A-60 as the lights will not flicker. A-60 can rarely spawn before Room A-060 as well.   </p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/2/2d/A90_Normal.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230213115418">
<p>
    When A-90 jumpscares the player, they must cease all mouse/keyboard input, including turning around, clicking, or even typing a single key, or they lose a varying amount of their health based on how late they ceased all mouse/keyboard input. The player can die in a single A-90 appearance if they are too late to cease all mouse/keyboard input. Like A-60, there's also a rare chance it will spawn before Room A-090.</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/4/47/%D0%90120_.png/revision/latest?cb=20230213115529">
<P> 
    This entity's behavior is similar to that of Ambush, but it isn't guaranteed to loop back. However, it spawns in the next few rooms ahead of the player. The player must hide if A-120 is heard, because the lights will not flicker.  </P>
